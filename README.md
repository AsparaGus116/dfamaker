# dfamaker
Dfa Maker is a desktop tool for creating and testing deterministic finite automaton machines. 
It is an interactive graphical tool that lets you edit, validate and save your DFA's in a JSON format. 
The graphical interface allows for fast edits and the moving of states and state arrows.
Additionally, it comes with an error checker, which indicates whether a DFA is deterministic, labeled correctly, etc.
Currently, the editing space is limited, but will be expanded in a later update.
